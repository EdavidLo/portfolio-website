            My name is <strong>David Loza</strong>, based in
            <em>Central Florida</em>. I’m passionate about growth,
            problem-solving, and creating meaningful experiences both at work
            and in life. My journey has taken me from managing fast-paced
            environments to exploring creative and technical roles, and now I’m
            working toward becoming a <span>Full-Stack Developer</span>.

            I hold an Associate’s Degree in Criminal Justice and have completed
            most of the coursework toward a Bachelor’s in Accounting, with about
            a year remaining. While life responsibilities required me to step
            away from finishing my degree, I’ve continued to expand my skills
            and remain committed to lifelong learning.

            I’ve worked as a Quality Control Specialist at a bottling company, a
            Manager at McDonald’s, and part-time in the courthouse criminal
            records department. I also gained digital experience at a small
            company, where I uploaded and managed website content using
            WordPress.

            My career has helped me build leadership, operations management,
            quality assurance, and technical content management skills. Today,

            my technical interests with my professional experience to design and
            develop modern applications.
